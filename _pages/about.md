Hello there! I am a developmental neuroscientist working as a Doctoral Resarcher in the Kucenas Lab at the University of Virginia. My current work utilizes larval zebrafish to study satellite glial cells and how they affect sensory neuron development, function, and regeneration after injury. Throughout my career, I've addressed a wide range of questions using a variety of models and experimental techniques, allowing me to cultivate a unique set of skills and perspectives as a scientist. Some of my expertise include confocal microscopy, transgenic tool creation, molecular cloning, and image analysis.

I am motivated by many different topics in science! But broadly speaking, much of my passion originates from questions that meet at the intersections of evolution, development, neuroscience, behavior, ecology, and biological diversity. 

Like some people, I have interests outside of science. I am obsessed with birds! I'm a local activist! I dance in my free time! I bike everywhere! I enjoy fancy beer! I am a fan of surreal comedy and absurd horror! I make art! I write! I bounce to loud live music! Seriously, I <i>really</i> like birds!

This site hosts my personal updates, peer-reviewed publications, contact info, and CV. Stay tuned for further changes and maybe some nice bird pictures.
