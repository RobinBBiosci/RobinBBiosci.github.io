Hello! I am a trans woman and developmental neuroscientist working as a Doctoral Resarcher in the Kucenas Lab at the University of Virginia. My work utilizes larval zebrafish to study satellite glial cells and how they affect sensory neuron development, function, and regeneration after injury. Before neuroscience, my career led me through fields of sunflowers, the nascent body plans of flies, and the fibrotic kidneys of mice. The diversity of these projects has allowed me to cultivate a unique perspective and set of skills as a scientist. A few of my expertise include confocal microscopy, transgenic tool creation, molecular cloning, and image analysis. Many domains fuel my curiosity! Broadly, much of my passion originates from questions that meet at the intersections of evolution, development, neuroscience, behavior, ecology, and biological diversity. 

Like some people, I have non-science interests. I like birds! I'm an activist! I dance! I bike! I love horror films! I jump around at loud concerts! Seriously, I <i>really</i> like birds!

This site hosts my personal updates, peer-reviewed publications, contact info, and CV. Stay tuned for further changes and maybe some nice avian images.
