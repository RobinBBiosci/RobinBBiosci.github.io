Hello! I am a trans woman, a scientist, and a person that cares about people. I recently earned my Ph.D. working as a developmental neuroscientist in the Kucenas Lab at the University of Virginia. My research utilized larval zebrafish to study satellite glial cells and how they affect sensory neuron development, function, and regeneration after injury. 

Before neuroscience, my career led me through fields of sunflowers, the nascent body plans of flies, and the fibrotic kidneys of mice. The diversity of these projects has allowed me to cultivate a unique perspective and set of skills as a scientist. Some of my expertise include confocal microscopy, transgenic tool creation, molecular cloning, and image analysis. Many domains fuel my curiosity! Broadly, much of my passion originates from questions that meet at the intersections of evolution, development, neuroscience, behavior, ecology, and biological diversity. 

I am currently on the job market searching for opportunities that challenge my comfort zone and expand my professional training as a researcher.

Like most people, I have non-science interests. I bird! I dance! I bike! I crave horror films! I jump around at loud concerts! Seriously, I really like birds! This site hosts my personal updates, peer-reviewed publications, contact info, and a minimal CV. Stay tuned for further changes and maybe some pleasant pictures of passing passeriforms.
