	abstract = {Signal transduction cascades initiated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) integrate a number of components including seven-pass transmembrane receptors (7TM), heterotrimeric G-proteins, downstream protein kinases and responsive transcription factors. This signalling pathway has evolved to facilitate a number of cellular responses related to metabolism, cell proliferation, neurotransmission, DNA repair and many other critical processes. Gene duplication and subfunctionalisation events have contributed to the emergence of several core components of the GPCR signalling pathway over the course of eukaryotic evolutionary history. Four key components of this pathway include GPCRs, receptor-associated heterotrimeric G-proteins, downstream kinase targets, such as protein kinase A (PKA) and transcription factors such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Key Concepts G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven-pass transmembrane proteins, which have diversified into five main families over evolutionary time. Heterotrimeric G-proteins transduce nuanced responses via different combinations of α, β and γ-subunits, which have evolved from numerous well-defined duplication events. Protein kinase A (PKA) is a downstream hub whose catalytic and regulatory subunits have diversified in eukaryotic lineages. The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) function is highly conserved in eukaryotes while the auxiliary components of its pathway have changed.},

	abstract = {Solar tracking in the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus, is a dramatic example of a diurnal rhythm in plants. During the day, the shoot apex continuously reorients, following the sun's relative position so that the developing heads track from east to west. At night, the reverse happens, and the heads return and face east in anticipation of dawn. This daily cycle dampens and eventually stops at anthesis, after which the sunflower head maintains an easterly orientation. Although shoot apical heliotropism has long been the subject of physiological studies in sunflower, the underlying developmental, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that drive the directional growth and curvature of the stem in response to extrinsic and perhaps intrinsic cues are not known. Furthermore, the ecological functions of solar tracking and the easterly orientation of mature heads have been the subject of significant but unresolved speculation. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge about this complex, dynamic trait. Candidate mechanisms that may contribute to daytime and nighttime movement are highlighted, including light signaling, hormonal action, and circadian regulation of growth pathways. The merits of the diverse hypotheses advanced to explain the adaptive significance of heliotropism in sunflower are also considered.},

	abstract = {Young sunflower plants track the Sun from east to west during the day and then reorient during the night to face east in anticipation of dawn. In contrast, mature plants cease movement with their flower heads facing east. We show that circadian regulation of directional growth pathways accounts for both phenomena and leads to increased vegetative biomass and enhanced pollinator visits to flowers. Solar tracking movements are driven by antiphasic patterns of elongation on the east and west sides of the stem. Genes implicated in control of phototropic growth, but not clock genes, are differentially expressed on the opposite sides of solar tracking stems. Thus, interactions between environmental response pathways and the internal circadian oscillator coordinate physiological processes with predictable changes in the environment to influence growth and reproduction.},

	abstract = {Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are specified from discrete precursor populations during gliogenesis and migrate extensively from their origins, ultimately distributing throughout the brain and spinal cord during early development. Subsequently, a subset of OPCs differentiates into mature oligodendrocytes, which myelinate axons. This process is necessary for efficient neuronal signaling and organism survival. Previous studies have identified several factors that influence OPC development, including excitatory glutamatergic synapses that form between neurons and OPCs during myelination. However, little is known about how glutamate signaling affects OPC migration before myelination. In this study, we use in vivo, time-lapse imaging in zebrafish in conjunction with genetic and pharmacological perturbation to investigate OPC migration and myelination when the GluR4A ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit is disrupted. In our studies, we observed that gria4a mutant embryos and larvae displayed abnormal OPC migration and altered dorsoventral distribution in the spinal cord. Genetic mosaic analysis confirmed that these effects were cell-autonomous, and we identified that voltage-gated calcium channels were downstream of glutamate receptor signaling in OPCs and could rescue the migration and myelination defects we observed when glutamate signaling was perturbed. These results offer new insights into the complex system of neuron-OPC interactions and reveal a cell-autonomous role for glutamatergic signaling in OPCs during neural development.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) is an essential process during development that leads to uniform oligodendrocyte distribution and sufficient myelination for central nervous system function. Here, we demonstrate that the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluR4A is an important driver of OPC migration and myelination in vivo and that activated voltage-gated calcium channels are downstream of glutamate receptor signaling in mediating this migration.},

	abstract = {Effective insect pollination requires appropriate responses to internal and external environmental cues in both the plant and the pollinator. Helianthus annuus, a highly outcrossing species, is marked for its uniform eastward orientation of mature pseudanthia, or capitula. Here we investigate how this orientation affects floral microclimate and the consequent effects on plant and pollinator interactions and reproductive fitness. We artificially manipulated sunflower capitulum orientation and temperature in both field and controlled conditions and assessed flower physiology, pollinator visits, seed traits and siring success. East-facing capitula were found to have earlier style elongation, pollen presentation and pollinator visits compared with capitula manipulated to face west. East-facing capitula also sired more offspring than west-facing capitula and under some conditions produced heavier and better-filled seeds. Local ambient temperature change on the capitulum was found to be a key factor regulating the timing of style elongation, pollen emergence and pollinator visits. These results indicate that eastward capitulum orientation helps to control daily rhythms in floral temperature, with direct consequences on the timing of style elongation and pollen emergence, pollinator visitation, and plant fitness.},

Using mice harboring fluorescent cell lineage tracers, single-cell RNA-Seq, and long-term inhibition of RAS in both mice and humans, we found that deletion of renin or inhibition of the RAS leads to concentric thickening of the intrarenal arteries and arterioles. This severe disease was caused by the multiclonal expansion and transformation of renin cells from a classical endocrine phenotype to a matrix-secretory phenotype: the cells surrounded the vessel walls and induced the accumulation of adjacent smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix, resulting in blood flow obstruction, focal ischemia, and fibrosis. Ablation of the renin cells via conditional deletion of β1 integrin prevented arteriolar hypertrophy, indicating that renin cells are responsible for vascular disease. Given these findings, prospective morphological studies in humans are necessary to determine the extent of renal vascular damage caused by the widespread use of inhibitors of the RAS.},

Transgenic tools and fluorescent reporter lines are critical resources to investigate how glial subtypes develop and function. However, despite the many lines available in zebrafish, the community still lacks the ability to label all unique stages of glial development and specific subpopulations of cells. To address this issue, we screened zebrafish gene and enhancer trap lines to find a novel reporter for peripheral glial subtypes. From these, we generated the gSAIzGFFD37A transgenic line that expresses GFP in neural crest cells and central and peripheral glia. We found that the gene trap construct is located within an intron of erbb3b, a gene essential for glial development. Additionally, we confirmed that GFP+ ​cells express erbb3b along with sox10, a known glial marker. From our screen, we have identified the gSAIzGFFD37A line as a novel and powerful tool for studying glia in the developing zebrafish, as well as a new resource to manipulate erbb3b+ ​cells.},

	abstract = {Renin cells are crucial for survival — they control fluid-electrolyte and blood pressure homeostasis, vascular development, regeneration, and oxygen delivery to tissues. During embryonic development, renin cells are progenitors for multiple cell types that retain the memory of the renin phenotype. When there is a threat to survival, those descendants are transformed and reenact the renin phenotype to restore homeostasis. We tested the hypothesis that the molecular memory of the renin phenotype resides in unique regions and states of these cells’ chromatin. Using renin cells at various stages of stimulation, we identified regions in the genome where the chromatin is open for transcription, mapped histone modifications characteristic of active enhancers such as H3K27ac, and tracked deposition of transcriptional activators such as Med1, whose deletion results in ablation of renin expression and low blood pressure. Using the rank ordering of super-enhancers, epigenetic rewriting, and enhancer deletion analysis, we found that renin cells harbor a unique set of super-enhancers that determine their identity. The most prominent renin super-enhancer may act as a chromatin sensor of signals that convey the physiologic status of the organism, and is responsible for the transformation of renin cell descendants to the renin phenotype, a fundamental process to ensure homeostasis.},
